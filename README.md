* Intuitive interface
* In-page video loading
* External video hosting

## Motivations
* Didn't want to require users to visit an external page (customer previously sent users to google drive for every video)
* Wanted to be able host videos on any platform, and use a static (free) host for the site itself (i.e. [surge.sh](https://surge.sh/) or [github pages](https://pages.github.com/))
* Wanted fairly universal usability, across devices of all types

## Technologies
* [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/)
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/)
* [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)

## Installation
* [Install NodeJS and GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/tutorial/part-zero/) _(gatsby has step by step instructions at the link)_
* Fork the repository
* Clone the repository locally
* Navigate to the cloned repository in your command line
* Install dependencies using `npm install`
* Run `gatsby develop` and start editing the files to make it your own!

## Disclaimers & Notes
* This is my first _real_ usage of React, Node, Gatsby, or even JS, in any capacity
